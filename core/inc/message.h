/** @file       message.h
 *
 *  @brief      Defines structures and function prototypes for creating, 
 *              inspecting and disposing of messages published to the 
 *              message broker.
 *
 *  @details    A message essentially has two components:
 *              - Properties represented as key/value pairs where both the
 *                key and value are strings
 *              - The content of the message which is simply a memory buffer
 *                (a @c BUFFER_HANDLE)
 *
 *              This header provides functions that enable the creation,
 *              inspection and destruction of messages. A message is represented
 *              via a #MESSAGE_HANDLE which is an opaque reference to a message
 *              instance. Messages are immutable and reference counted; their 
 *              lifetime is managed via the #Message_Clone and #Message_Destroy 
 *              APIs which atomically increment and decrement the reference 
 *              count respectively. #Message_Destroy deallocates the message 
 *              completely when the reference count becomes zero.
