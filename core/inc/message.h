/** @file		message.h
*
*	@brief		Defines structures and function prototypes for creating, 
*				inspecting and disposing off messages published on to the 
*				message bus.
*
*	@details	A message essentially has two components:
*					- Properties represented as key/value pairs where both the
*					key and value are strings
*					- The content of the message which is simply a memory buffer
*					(a @c BUFFER_HANDLE)
*			
*				This header provides functions that enable the creation, inspection
*				and destruction of messages. A message is represented via a
*				#MESSAGE_HANDLE which is an opaque reference to a message
*				instance. Messages are immutable and reference counted; their 
*				lifetime is managed via the #Message_Clone and #Message_Destroy 
*				APIs which atomically increment and decrement the reference 
*				count respectively. #Message_Destroy deallocates the message 
*				completely when the reference count becomes zero.
